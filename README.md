## 🚀 What is this?

This repo is a **digital scrapyard** of my brain battling LeetCode problems — from "Hello World" level to "Why did I even try this?" 💀  
If you’ve ever screamed at your code for failing test case #983 of 984 — you’re in the right place.

> ⚠️ Warning: May contain brute force, caffeine-fueled logic, and the occasional stroke of genius.

## 🧠 Structure

Problems are sorted by:
- 🟩 **Difficulty** – Easy, Medium, Hard
- 💡 **Topic** – Arrays, Strings, Graphs, Trees, Dynamic Programming, etc.
- 📁 **Language** – Mainly Python (but who knows what mood I was in...)

---

## 📌 Why?

Because:
- LeetCode told me to.
- My future self will forget how I solved this.
- I enjoy the illusion of productivity.

## 🧃 Stay Hydrated, Debug Gently

Remember:  
If at first you don’t succeed, console.log it and cry later.  
Or as we call it — **"debugging"**.
